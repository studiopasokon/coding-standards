# Tools and Applications

Following tools are preferred for coding purposes:

- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/): open source IDE without the telemetry of Visual Studio Code.
- [Samsung .NET Core debugger](https://github.com/Samsung/netcoredbg): will have to be used as VSCodium has no debugger available.
