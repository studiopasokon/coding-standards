# Tools and Applications

Following tools are preferred for coding purposes:

- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/): open source IDE without the telemetry of Visual Studio Code.
- [Samsung .NET Core debugger](https://github.com/Samsung/netcoredbg): will have to be used as VSCodium has no debugger available.

## Installing a Debugger

Installing the Samsung .NET Core debugger has been made easier by a custom extension made available on the [Open VSX registry](https://open-vsx.org).

Download the C# extension (muhammad-sammy.csharp, free-omnisharp-vscode) to get (a copy of) the Omnisharp C# extension and the Samsung .NET Core debugger available to all C# projects:

- [Extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/muhammad-sammy/csharp)
- [GitHub project](https://github.com/muhammadsammy/free-omnisharp-vscode)
